## It's blazing fast

I wanted a fast, native Windows applicaton to explore lock Docker content during my development sessions. Docker console is great, but sometimes it's taking too much time to find what I need, therefore this tool.

### Why not Electron?

Because Electron runs 5 web servers to show a simple UI window and dramatically slows down an average PC. In my personal opinion, Electron is a productivity killer (what's the point of waiting for UI if I can do it in the terminal so much faster). Native UI in this tool is blazing fast.
